                <p>Grand Bazaar. It's for tourists and expensive. Some of money changers offer good rate, but bad money
                    changers offer 20% lower rate. Is it a Turkish joke?</p>
                <img src="https://scidoggames.com/images/blog/istanbul-turkey/2.webp" alt="Hagia Sophia photo" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900">
                <p>Hagia Sophia, most famous mosque in Istanbul. I love here and visited often. In this area, often
                    someone talks to me in Japanese, then I say "你好!" in Chinese and ignore them. Istanbul is famous for
                    scam city and be careful!</p>
                <img src="https://scidoggames.com/images/blog/istanbul-turkey/3.webp" alt="Basilica Cistern photo" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900">
                <p>Basilica Cistern. In Japanese, it's called "地下神殿" (= underground temple). The multiple scroll of the
                    pillars reminds me of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ys_III:_Wanderers_from_Ys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Ys III: Wanderers from Ys"</a>.</p>

                <p>Topkapi Palace Museum. It's walking course for 2 hours and half rather than museum and the entry fee
                    with Harem option is TL 170 (= USD 24). Usually lunch is around TL 10 and dinner is TL 20~30 in
                    Istanbul. How many times can I eat?</p>
                <img src="https://scidoggames.com/images/blog/istanbul-turkey/5.webp" alt="Galata Bridge photo" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900">
                <p>Galata Bridge connects Eminönü and Karaköy. This area is famous for mackerel sandwich.</p>
                <img src="https://scidoggames.com/images/blog/istanbul-turkey/6.webp" alt="Mackerel sandwich of Eminönü photo" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900">
                <p>Mackerel sandwich of Eminönü. Just a mackerel and bread with fish bone and little bit expensive.</p>
                <img src="https://scidoggames.com/images/blog/istanbul-turkey/7.webp" alt="Mackerel sandwich of Karaköy photo" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900">
                <p>Mackerel sandwich of Karaköy. Good taste, no fish bone and cheaper. You should eat this!</p>
